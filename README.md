This is a simple tool cobbled together to take the [semi-official list](https://github.com/aalmiray/java-champions) and populate a less than official but at least 
uptodate [twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1226854976112254976).  This script is run nightly to ensure the twitter list has all the Java Champions at least
as listed in the other github repo.

Please feel free to subscribe to the [twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1226854976112254976) to get all your Java Champion goodness in one place.
